## 🎮 About The Game

This is not a simple linear story.

The game is built as a **decision-driven adventure engine** where:

- Every choice affects your path
- Outcomes change dynamically
- Randomized events make each run different
- Multiple endings exist (good, bad, hidden, and unexpected)

Players must make smart decisions to survive and achieve the highest score.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

This project was designed to apply core Computer Science concepts including:

- Structured Programming
- State Management
- File Persistence
- Input Validation
- Branching Logic Systems
- Randomized Event Generation
- Modular Function Design
- User Data Handling
- Control Flow Architecture

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Account System
- Sign Up / Sign In functionality
- Stored using JSON-based persistence
- Each user has their own high score

### 💾 Persistent Progress
- Accounts and scores saved locally
- Data loaded automatically on next session

### 🌍 Large Branching Story World
- 60+ decision branches
- Many unique story paths

### 🧭 Multiple Endings System
- The game contains 32 different endings, including:
- 8 Winning Endings — achieved through careful decision-making and strategic choices.
- 24 Losing Endings — resulting from risky, impulsive, or incorrect paths.
- This design encourages players to replay the game, explore alternative decisions, and discover hidden successful routes.

### 🎲 Randomized Gameplay Elements
Each playthrough includes variations such as:
- Different enemies
- Environmental descriptions
- Sound and atmosphere changes

This ensures **high replayability**.

### 🏆 Scoring System
- Choices influence your total score
- Winning requires strategy (not luck)
- Risk vs reward decisions matter

### 🖥️ Pure Terminal Experience
- No external libraries required
- Runs entirely in the command line
- Focused on logic rather than graphics
